# Intro-to-R

Part 3:

When considering what I would use for part 1 and 2 using python, as well as using chatGPT for insight, I've noticed a few similarities and differences. One difference is that R does not have Numpy or Pandas libraries to load the dataset and manipulate arrays. also when using numpy, the user has to go up a number for 50 to be inclusive in the array. Here is an example of using numpy for part 1, vector_1_to_50 = np.arange(1, 51); In my code using R, I could use 1:50 and 50 is already inclusive. Lastly, when referencing chatGPT, my R code and the python code, I noticed that using mean and standard deviation was similar to each other. For python, I would Auto[col].mean() as an example; For R, I would use mean(Auto[[col]]).
